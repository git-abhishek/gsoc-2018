# Improve test coverage and test performance

## Abstract


Short description of your project. Max 10 sentences. This **SHOULD NOT** be a
copy of the project idea text.

## Technical Details

Long description of the project. **Must** include all technical details of the
projects like libraries involved.

Here it is important to show if you had previous conversations with your
mentors. You can show relevant pieces of code that you want to change. You can
link to literature you used during the research.

## Schedule of Deliverables

Here should come a list of your milestones. This list is a start based on the
difference phases of GSoC. Use it as a start. You can/should add more details
for each phase by breaking it down into weeks or set specific targets for each
phase. Each target should be split into sub task with a time estimate, [work
breakdown structures][wbs] are helpful here.

### **Community Bonding Period**

This phase is to get to know the community better. Check that your build
environment is setup. This time should also be used to discuss your project in
more detail with the community and in general introduce it. 

*Note:* We require you to write regular blog posts. Now is a good time to make
sure your blog works and send us the link.

### **Phase 1**

Delieverables

### **Phase 2**

Delieverables

### **Final Week**

At this stage you should finish up your project. At this stage you should make
sure that you have code submitted to your organization. Our criteria to mark
your project as a success is to submit code before the end of GSoC.

## Development Experience

I have 3 years 3 months of work experience as a software developer engineer at various technology [companies](#3-work-experience). During these years, I worked on many different technologies ranging from Java, Python, C/C++/C#, ASP.NET, SQL to JavaScript, jQuery, HTML/CSS and learnt many frameworks. This experience has not only made me a better developer but also taught me to reach for coding excellence. It exposed me to the skills that make a developer complete like working in global teams, timely delivery of production code in large codebases and taking product ownership. Thus, I feel I am competent enough to work on this project.

As part of my coursework in [Neural Networks](https://compsci682.github.io/) I implemented deep learning library in python. For the course [Applied Infromation Retrieval](http://ciir.cs.umass.edu/~dfisher/cs546/syllabus.html), I created a toy search engine in Java that could efficiently index the corpus and return ranked query results. This semester in [AI](http://rbr.cs.umass.edu/shlomo/classes/683/index.html) I am implementing search algorithms like A*, constraint satisfaction problems, minimax adverserial search and others. In [Intelligent Visual Computing](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~kalo/courses/visual_computing/index.html) I am writing Matlab code for 3D shape reconstruction, deepnet eye detector and marching cubes. Furthermore, I am implementing a simulator based [robot](http://www-robotics.cs.umass.edu/~grupen/603/handouts/syllabus.html) in C with 9 degrees of freedom. Since all these projects are forbidden to be shared publicly, I do not have them on GitHub. (I will be required to take professors' permission, in case I need to send it privately to the reviewers.)    

Yt is my first open source community and thus I do not have any contributions that are publicly available. However, I have made 2 PRs till now to fix issues [#1680](https://github.com/yt-project/yt/issues/1680) and [#1599](https://github.com/yt-project/yt/pull/1705).
